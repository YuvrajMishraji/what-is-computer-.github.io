    <p><u>What is Computer?</u></p>
    <p class="p2">• <u>Definition</u>:-<span class="s1">A computer is an electronic machine that calculates arithmetic 
        and logical operations.</span></p>

    <p class="p3">• <u>How Computer Works?</u>:-<br><span class="s3">Firstly, it takes input data through input devices and processed them by CPU 
        <span class="s2">(Central Processing Unit)</span>.Finally, it gives result as output data through output devices.</span></p>
   
    <p class="p4">• <u>Parts Of Computer</u>:-<br>
        <u><span class="s4">There are four main parts of computer:-</span></u></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s5">1.</span>CPU<br><span class="s5">2.</span>Monitor
           <br> <span class="s5">3.</span>Keyboard<br><span class="s5">4.</span>Mouse</p>

    <p class="p4"><u>Now we describe all four parts one by one:-</u></p> 
    <p class="p5"><span class="s6">1.CPU:-</span>CPU is the central processing unit which
    takes input data through input device and processed them and give us result as output.
    CPU has three parts:-<br><span class="s5">i)</span>MU (Memory Unit)<br><span class="s5">ii)</span>ALU (Arithmetic and Logic unit)<br><span class="s5">iii)</span>CU (Control Unit)</p>
    
    <p class="p5"><span class="s6">2.Monitor:-</span>Monitors are type of LED displays which uses an array of light-emitting
    diodes as pixels. It shows output as video, images etc.</p>

    <p class="p5"><span class="s6">3.Keyboard:-</span>Keyboard is a type of device which use to type letters, symbols etc. in computer as input. It is an input device.
    Keyboard is of two types, <span class="s5">Wired</span> and <span class="s5">Wireless Keyboard</span>. Wired keyboards are connected with wires whereas wireless keyboards are connected wirelessly
through infrared (IR) or Bluetooth technology.</p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s6">4.Mouse:-</span>A computer mouse is a type of pointing device (hand control) which allows a smooth scroll. Mouse is of two types, <span class="s5">Wired</span> and <span class="s5">Wireless Mouse</span>. Wired mouse are connected with wires whereas wireless mouse are connected wirelessly
    through infrared (IR) or Bluetooth technology.</p>

    <p class="p4">•<span class="s6">Some Input Device:-</span><br><span class="s4">Keyboard, Mouse, Light Pen, Track Ball, Scanner, Digitizer, Joystick etc.</span></p>

    <p class="p4">•<span class="s6">Some Output Device:-</span><br><span class="s4">Monitor, Printer, Plotter, Projector, Speakers, Headphones, Sound Card, Video Card etc.</span></p>
